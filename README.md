# Super-sample-project

## Introduction:
The Sample Superstore data contains sales information for a fictional superstore chain. The data includes information about customers, locations, dates,
and products.  This analysis will explore the data to gain insights into customer purchasing behavior, location-based sales trends, date-based sales patterns, and products  performance analysis.

### Executive summary:

My analysis of the Sample Superstore data reveals several key insights. It was found that the top-performing region is the West, with 30% of total sales. The top-selling product category is Technology, with 36.4% of total sales and about 50% profit contribution, while the Furniture category is contributing 6.4% profit value despite having a sale volume of 31%. Out of over two millions of revenue generated, the profit margin is just 12.47%. Mr Emily Phan is the number one customer by total orders made. Additionally, we found that the average order value is $459.

### Abstract:
This analysis explores the Sample Superstore data to identify trends and patterns in customer purchasing behavior, location-based sales trends, date-based sales patterns, and product-based sales performance. Using dimensional modeling and data visualization techniques, I identified key insights and provided recommendations for the superstore business.

### Methodology:
The following steps were used to prepare and analyze the data:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing: I removed any missing or duplicate values as well as columns not needed from the data.
2. Data transformation and aggregation: I transformed the data into a dimensional model, with customer, location, date, and product dimensions.
3. Data visualization and exploration: I used Power BI to create visualizations and explore the data.

 ### Findings:
 The Top profitable product is Copiers followed by phones both from Home office and technology category respectively.
The least profitable product is Tables .
Overall technology category is leading in terms profit and sales
The west region is leading in terms of revenue generation while the least region in terms revenue is East
New York is the leading city in sales
Cannon imageCLASS 2200 Advance Copier is the highest selling product .
The average order value is $459.
November is the peak month of revenue worth $118k.
Wednesday and Monday are the storeâ€™s busiest days. 

### Recomendations:
I recommend  products optimization in furniture category where despite having good sales volume, recorded the least profit.
The following should be put into consideration; Pricing, branding, packaging, distribution channels and quality of the products.
Where the No 2 above is achieved and the trend continued, I recommend that production of products like tables, bookcases, suppliers etc. should be discontinued to avoid loss of capital.
Implement a loyalty program to reward repeat customers.
Offer personalized marketing campaigns to target high-value customers.
Implement regional marketing campaigns to target high-performing cities or states.
